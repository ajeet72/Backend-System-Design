## Introduction
This project implements a backend system designed to efficiently manage requests from multiple users using a queue structure. Each connected client has its own queue where all requests are processed sequentially. The system is robust, scalable, and ensures that the queue is emptied once all requests are processed and users disconnect.

## System Architecture
The system is built on a microservices architecture, where different services are responsible for specific tasks. The architecture includes the following key components:

- **Client Interface**: The user interacts with the system via this interface (e.g., web or mobile app).
- **API Gateway**: The entry point for all client requests, responsible for routing requests to appropriate services.
- **Authentication Service**: Securely authenticates users before they can enqueue requests.
- **Request Queue (Redis)**: A separate queue is maintained for each authenticated user, ensuring that requests are processed in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) manner.
- **Worker Processes**: Dedicated workers that pull requests from the queues and process them sequentially.
- **Database (PostgreSQL)**: Stores user data, request logs, and other necessary information.
- **Monitoring Tools (Prometheus, Grafana)**: Monitor the system's performance and log metrics.

## Components

### 1. **Client Interface**
The front-end application (e.g., React.js) that users interact with to send requests to the backend system.

### 2. **API Gateway**
The central point of access for the system. It handles routing, load balancing, and directing requests to appropriate services.

### 3. **Authentication Service**
A microservice responsible for verifying user credentials and issuing tokens. This service ensures that only authenticated users can interact with the system.

### 4. **Request Queue (Redis)**
Redis is used to manage the queues. Each authenticated user has a dedicated queue where their requests are stored until processed by a worker.

### 5. **Worker Processes**
Worker processes are responsible for pulling requests from the Redis queues and processing them. They interact with the database to fulfill the requests and ensure data consistency.

### 6. **Database (PostgreSQL)**
PostgreSQL is used to store persistent data, including user information, processed requests, and system logs.

### 7. **Monitoring Tools (Prometheus, Grafana)**
Prometheus collects metrics from the system, and Grafana is used to visualize this data. Together, they provide insights into the system’s performance and help in identifying potential issues.

## Process Flow

1. **User Authentication**: 
   - A user sends a request to the API Gateway.
   - The request is forwarded to the Authentication Service, which verifies the user's credentials.
   - Upon successful authentication, a token is issued, and the user can proceed with making requests.

2. **Request Queueing**: 
   - Authenticated requests are enqueued in the user’s dedicated Redis queue.
   - The queues are managed in a FIFO manner to ensure requests are processed in order.

3. **Request Processing**: 
   - Worker processes pull requests from the queues and execute them.
   - The workers interact with the PostgreSQL database to perform necessary operations.

4. **Response Handling**: 
   - Once processed, the result is sent back to the user via the API Gateway.
   - The request and its result are logged for monitoring and debugging purposes.

5. **Monitoring**: 
   - Prometheus collects system metrics, which are visualized in Grafana dashboards.
   - Alerts can be configured in Grafana to notify administrators of any issues.
